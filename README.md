## Exact size iterator traits

Rust traits (and blanket impls) for working with statically sized structures which are nevertheless convenient to construct from iterators.

As an example, these were written to help deal with the statically-yet-generically sized `Vect`, `Mat`, `Array`, and `Data` types from [leviathan](http://github.com/sdleffler/leviathan).
